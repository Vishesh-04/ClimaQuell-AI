# ClimaQuell

## Project Overview

In todayâ€™s rapidly changing world, access to real-time environmental data is essential for decision-making in agriculture, urban planning, and resource management. **ClimaQuell** is an AI-powered chatbot providing users with timely weather and groundwater insights across regions in India, with plans for global expansion. This platform is designed to support users such as farmers, policy-makers, researchers, and tourists with essential environmental information.

## Problem Statement

### Weather Monitoring

Accurate and timely weather data is critical for industries like agriculture, tourism, and logistics. Many platforms offer only basic weather insights, often lacking the depth needed for informed decision-making.

### Groundwater Insights

Groundwater is a vital resource, especially in areas with irregular rainfall. Accessing reliable data on groundwater levels and quality is often challenging, particularly in rural regions.

## Solution Overview

ClimaQuell addresses these challenges by providing real-time weather and groundwater data, including:

- Temperature, humidity, and wind data for any specified region.
- Groundwater details, such as water table depth and quality metrics.

## Key Use Cases

1. **Farmers**  
   Plan irrigation and crop scheduling based on current weather and groundwater conditions.

2. **Government Agencies**  
   Monitor groundwater levels and climate conditions for efficient resource management.

3. **Tourists**  
   Access weather forecasts and local water data for informed travel planning.
