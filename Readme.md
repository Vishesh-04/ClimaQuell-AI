## Project Overview

In todayâ€™s rapidly changing world, access to real-time environmental data is essential for decision-making in agriculture, urban planning, and resource management. This AI chatbot provides users with timely weather and groundwater insights for regions across India, with plans to expand globally. The platform is designed to support users such as farmers, policy-makers, researchers, and tourists with essential environmental insights.

## Problem Statement

### Weather Monitoring

Accurate and timely weather data is crucial for industries like agriculture, tourism, and logistics. Many platforms only provide basic weather insights, which may lack the detail needed for informed decisions.

### Groundwater Insights

Groundwater is a vital resource, especially in regions with irregular rainfall. However, accessing reliable data on groundwater levels and quality remains challenging, particularly in rural areas.

## Solution Overview

Our AI chatbot addresses these challenges by offering real-time weather and groundwater data, including:

- Temperature, humidity, and wind data for any region.
- Groundwater details such as water table depth and quality metrics.

## Key Use Cases

### 1. Farmers

Plan irrigation and crop scheduling based on current weather and groundwater conditions.

### 2. Government Agencies

Monitor groundwater levels and climate conditions for efficient resource management.

### 3. Tourists

Access weather forecasts and local water data for informed travel planning.
